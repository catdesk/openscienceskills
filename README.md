This document tries to gather information about how to become a good (open) scientist and follow the highest standard in data management and dissemination. The audience is primarily PhD students, but more experienced researchers may also benefit from it.

It is written in markdown using knitr (and Rstudio).

If you want to help me, you may:
- post issues on the github page
- use github functionality to modify the markdown files: fork and pull request!

The document is produced by running the renderproject.r file. Each section is written in a different rmd file present in the children folder (such that sections may be added/removed or reodered following the "children" list found in the .r file).
